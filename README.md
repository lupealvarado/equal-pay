# Mell Industries Pay Equity Analysis

This repository contains a project that analyzes employee data from Mell Industries, a national manufacturing firm based in Chicago. The objective of the project is to evaluate pay equity within the company and determine if allegations of equal pay discrimination have merit. The project also aims to design business controls for ensuring equity in all pay scales and functional roles.

## Project Overview

The project involves performing data analysis using Microsoft Excel 2016. The analysis uses various functions, calculations, and pivot tables to evaluate employee data and create an executive summary and visualization. The dataset includes 12 columns of employee information, and the project requires creating a performance rating logic.

## Steps Involved

1. **Analysis File**: Downloaded the initial dataset provided by Mell Industries and created a new Excel workbook named 'MyAnalysis.xlsx'. This workbook was used to create additional sheets to analyze the data more closely. The completed worksheet served as a major artifact to either support or refute the allegations of equal pay discrimination.

2. **Data Migration**: Migrated the data from the initial dataset to the `MyAnalysis.xlsx` workbook. Created separate sheets for `Female_Employees` and `Male_Employees` and filtered the data accordingly.

3. **Job Duration Calculation**: Inserted a new column titled `Job Duration` between `Termination Date` and `Occupation` and calculated the length of employment for each employee.

4. **Employee Evaluation Metrics**: Summarizde the five metrics (Knowledge of Work, Communication, Teamwork, Leadership, and Quality of Work) to the following criteria: Exceeds Expectations (3), Meets Expectations (2), Below Expectations (1). Used a formula to determine the Evaluation Score by rounding the average of all 5 metrics.

5. **Data Analysis (Executive Summary)**: Answered the Top 10 Highest Paid Positions section using pivot tables. Used linked references to populate results for male vs. female.

6. **Create Visualization**: Provided visualization using charts tied to the executive summary. Created a chart for Salary by Employee Count - Compared COUNT of both male and female employees.

## Challenges Encountered

The project was challenging, especially when it came to creating pivot tables and visualizations. The Excel functions required for each field in the data analysis were also quite complex. However, with the help of the provided hints and some additional research, I was able to overcome these challenges.

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to apply my Excel skills in a real-world scenario. It was a little challenging but rewarding, and I learned a lot about data analysis and pay equity. I hope that the findings of this project will help Mell Industries to ensure pay equity among all their employees.

## Deliverables

The completed Microsoft Excel file is the main deliverable of this project. It contains all the analysis and visualizations created during the project.
